The LSTM model performed better than ARIMA, with lower MAE (3.25 vs 4.89) and RMSE (4.21 vs 5.92), indicating more accurate predictions. LSTM is more flexible and captures complex, nonlinear temporal patterns without requiring stationarity. ARIMA, while faster and interpretable, assumes linearity and stationarity, which limits its adaptability to real-world financial data. Therefore, LSTM is more suitable for stock price forecasting when sufficient data and compute resources are available. However, ARIMA remains a strong baseline for quick, transparent forecasts.
